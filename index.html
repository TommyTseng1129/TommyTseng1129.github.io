							<h2 style = 'text-align:center'>WELCOME TO MY PAGE</h2>
							<p>Hi! I am Tommy Tseng, a Data Science Master candidate at Duke University. I was born in Taiwan, but my family later moved to China when I was 12. I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, in which I was trained to be a team-oriented problem-solver. Experience wise, I summer-interned at Siemens Healthineers in 2021, and had previously spent almost 3 years working in 2 biomedical start-ups.</p>

							<p>In my second job, I was exposed to big data and its healthcare application, in which I saw the impact and changes big data can make on our life decisions, which inspired me to pursue further study in the field of data science. I have rich working experience in inter-discplinary projects and my passion is to reveal insightful information from big data, and helping people to make more well-informed decisions.</p>

							<p>After almost 3 years working in start-up companies, I've been cultivated to become an action-oriented and strategic person. Also, my current study at Duke University has equipped me with a data-driven mindset and the ability to ask good questions that would help identifying stakeholder's core needs. Because of my prior background in healthcare, I am also excited about data solutions that are socially meaningful.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Duke Datathon 2020</h3>
											<p>With the continuous outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, many health experts believe that the pandemic will not end in 2021, and the cease of the pandemic will likely involve a mix of efforts. I partnered with 3 otehr graduate-level students to provide a comprehensive data analysis and concrete data-driven recommendations on the devastating long-term economic implications of COVID-19. </p>
											<p>By leveraging several economic and Covid-19 specific data, our team built two models that would infer and predict the impact of COVID-19 on key economic indicators. As a result, our team won the 1st place in the competition.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Facial Expression Recognition in Remote Learning</h3>
											<p>The way education is delivered has been reshaped as the pandemic changes our livestyles.The goal of this project is to present a final application that can help content presenters (i.e: university instructors) to evaluate the overall performance of the class and improve communication efficiency. </p>
											<p>Specifically, this application detects real time facial expressions/engagement of the audience using a convolutional neural network in a video conference setting and assesses the overall sentiment/engagement.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis</h3>
											<p>As many industries are becoming more and more competitive, many companies are actually making use of big data to relocate resources and to maximize profit by providing goods and services that are valued most by most customers. This is not an exception for the airline industry. In this project, a passenger satisfaction data set is provided by an airline company. I will investigate the associations between different rated/recorded factors and passenger’s satisfaction, and will come up with a model that recommends the top 3 and least 3 factors this airline company should focus on when relocating their resources. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Impact Estimation of Opioid Control Policies</h3>
											<p>In response to the opioid epidemic, states have implemented policies with the goal of decreasing opioid prescriptions, addictions, and deaths.</p>
											<p>By collecting, cleaning, and restructuring million rows of data, this analysis evaluated the effectiveness of the implemented policy in three specific states that enacted stricter opioid regulations between 2007 and 2012.<p>
											<p>The analysis results were visualized and presented to technical and non-technical stakeholders as a final showcase.<p>

											<h3 class="major">Beijing House Prices Prediction Using AWS</h3>
											<p>In the interest of intergating what has been learned in my first semester at Duke University, my team decided to make use of AWS sagemaker to run a machine learning prediction analysis on a web-scrapped data. </p>
											<p>As one of the big cities in China, Beijing not only has a high population density, but also a big housing demand as more Chinese fresh graduates decide to pursue better job opportunities in this big city. <p>
											<p> Starting from data collection, data wrangling, model building to data visualization, our team was able to implement a complete machine learning pipeline on AWS.</p>
