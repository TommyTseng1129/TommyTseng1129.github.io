							<p>Hi, I’m Tommy, and I was trained as a data scientist in my master’s at Duke. In the past few years, I have been working in the data science field and have been helping people to make better decisions using data science and analytics skills.</p>

							<p>My first exposure to this field was working as a clinical data scientist at Darma. Within this role, I was able to walk through different phases of data pipeline, starting from data collection all the way to data analysis and data modeling . During my summer internship, I had the pleasure to join Siemens to optimize their workload estimation and engineer dispatching process by building an explainable predictive model.</p>

							<p>Currently, I have been working in the business analytics department at Siemens Healthineers. With almost 2 years here, I have gained trust from my customers by reducing the manual effort they spent in business reporting and helping them to create business impact with data-driven decision-making.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Duke Datathon 2020</h3>
											<p>With the continuous outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, many health experts believe that the pandemic will not end in 2021, and the cease of the pandemic will likely involve a mix of efforts. I partnered with 3 otehr graduate-level students to provide a comprehensive data analysis and concrete data-driven recommendations on the devastating long-term economic implications of COVID-19. </p>
											<p>By leveraging several economic and Covid-19 specific data, our team built two models that would infer and predict the impact of COVID-19 on key economic indicators. As a result, our team won the 1st place in the competition.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Wearable Technology in Identifying COVID-19</h3>
											<p>As COVID-19 cases started to climb in the U.S. and make their way into the Duke community, researchers from the Duke Schools of Medicine and Engineering began to search for solutions to problems felt or anticipated on local, national and global scales.  </p>
											<p>Using bio-data collected from wearable sensors, the team aims to develop a machine learning model that can early-detect onset of COVID or influenza-liked illnesses. On top of this, the team is also generating an automated dashboard to track the targeted population and available bio-data.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Facial Expression Recognition in Remote Learning</h3>
											<p>The way education is delivered has been reshaped as the pandemic changes our livestyles.The goal of this project is to present a final application that can help content presenters (i.e: university instructors) to evaluate the overall performance of the class and improve communication efficiency. </p>
											<p>Specifically, this application detects real time facial expressions/engagement of the audience using a convolutional neural network in a video conference setting and assesses the overall sentiment/engagement.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis</h3>
											<p>As many industries are becoming more and more competitive, many companies are actually making use of big data to relocate resources and to maximize profit by providing goods and services that are valued most by most customers. This is not an exception for the airline industry. In this project, a passenger satisfaction data set is provided by an airline company. I will investigate the associations between different rated/recorded factors and passenger’s satisfaction, and will come up with a model that recommends the top 3 and least 3 factors this airline company should focus on when relocating their resources. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Impact Estimation of Opioid Control Policies</h3>
											<p>In response to the opioid epidemic, states have implemented policies with the goal of decreasing opioid prescriptions, addictions, and deaths.</p>
											<p>By collecting, cleaning, and restructuring million rows of data, this analysis evaluated the effectiveness of the implemented policy in three specific states that enacted stricter opioid regulations between 2007 and 2012.<p>
											<p>The analysis results were visualized and presented to technical and non-technical stakeholders as a final showcase.<p>

											<h3 class="major">Beijing House Prices Prediction Using AWS</h3>
											<p>In the interest of intergating what has been learned in my first semester at Duke University, my team decided to make use of AWS sagemaker to run a machine learning prediction analysis on a web-scrapped data. </p>
											<p>As one of the big cities in China, Beijing not only has a high population density, but also a big housing demand as more Chinese fresh graduates decide to pursue better job opportunities in this big city. <p>
											<p> Starting from data collection, data wrangling, model building to data visualization, our team was able to implement a complete machine learning pipeline on AWS.</p>
